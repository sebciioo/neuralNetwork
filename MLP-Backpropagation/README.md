# Graphic Autoassociator

## Project Description

This project implements a **graphic autoassociator** that learns an RGB image using **backpropagation**. The network takes a point `(x, y)` on the image as input and outputs the corresponding `(r, g, b)` values, representing the color of the image at `(x, y)`.

To achieve better results, the input to the network includes the coordinates `(x, y)` transformed using **trigonometric functions** (e.g., `sin(x)`, `cos(x)`, `sin(2x)`, `cos(2x)`, `sin(3x)`, `cos(3x)`, etc., where `x` represents the coordinates `(x, y)`).

## Requirements

To run the project, you need:

- **Python 3.7** or newer.
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `Pillow`

Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib Pillow
```

## Features

- **Learning with backpropagation**:
  - The network is trained to approximate the `(r, g, b)` color values of an image.
- **Trigonometric input transformations**:
  - Trigonometric transformations of the `(x, y)` coordinates are used as additional features to improve learning performance.
- **Customizable architecture**:
  - The network supports flexible configurations, including the number of hidden layers and neurons per layer.
- **Image generation**:
  - After training, the network can recreate the original image by iterating through all `(x, y)` points.

## How to Run
1. Place the input image (e.g., image.png) in the data/ folder.
2. Run the program: 
```bash
python main.py
```
3. The program will:
- Preprocess the image and generate input features.
- Train the autoassociator using the provided data.
- Generate the reconstructed image and save it to the output/ folder.

## Customization
You can modify the network configuration by adjusting the following parameters in main.py:
- Number of neurons per layer
```bash
layer_sizes = [input_size, 256, 128, 3]
```
- Number of trigonometric transformations:
```bash
num_harmonics = 3
```
- Learning rate and training settings:
```bash
learning_rate = 0.01
min_epochs = 5000
error_tolerance = 0.01
```

---
## Output
A reconstructed image generated by the trained network.
