## Folder Structure

### 1. **ADALINE**
   - **Description**: 
     Contains the implementation of the ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron) model for digit classification using the MNIST dataset.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Trains individual ADALINE units to recognize digits (0-9).
     - Plots error graphs for each digit during training.
     - Provides accuracy metrics for test data.
     - 
### 2. **MLP-Backpropagation**

### 3. **multi-class-classifier**
   - **Description**:
     The project demonstrates the use of perceptrons for multi-class classification. Each perceptron is trained to recognize one specific class. Classes can be represented as binary patterns or multi-dimensional feature vectors.
   - **Key Features**:
      - Trains perceptrons to classify data into multiple categories.
      - Supports parameter tuning, such as learning rate and epochs.
      - Can be extended for complex datasets and advanced classification tasks
